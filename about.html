    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from Monash University, seeking a Graduate Web Development position. I have studied the MERN stack, building full stack web applications, deploying to Rendr and Github Pages. My strengths are in Front End development, however I would love a position which will allow me to further enhance my experience in Back End development, as well as automation testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my studies with Monash University, I have also spent 3 years as a Technical Recruiter, where I worked closely with senior candidates, as well as technical hiring managers, placing the most skilled developers in roles all around Australia.
